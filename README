This is a simple test that is suppose to settle the arguments about
using properties vs direct variables in ObjectiveC.

My take on it is: use properties, unless you really need direct quick access to variable. 
And if you do, think about writing that part of code in C or C++ instead. Otherwise, the code is just going to be one big mess.
